## Codebase Overview

| Category | Files | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Server TypeScript | 21 | `apps/server/src/**.ts` — Fastify app + entry, auth, sockets, AI, DB, sanitize, practice, tournament engine/store, routes |
| Frontend TypeScript / TSX | 41 | `apps/web/src/**.{ts,tsx}` — React app, pages, components, contexts, hooks, libs |
| CSS | 1 | `apps/web/src/styles/app.css` (PDC dark theme) |
| Server tests | 16 | `apps/server/test/*.test.ts` (vitest + `Fastify.inject()`) |
| Web tests | 2 | `apps/web/test/*.test.ts` |
| E2E tests | 2 | `e2e/*.spec.ts` (Playwright — 501 + cricket) |
| Docker | 2 | `Dockerfile` (multi-stage), `docker-compose.yml` |
| CI | 1 | `.forgejo/workflows/build-push.yml` |

**Stack:** Node.js 20 + Fastify 5 + Socket.IO 4 + better-sqlite3 (server) — React 18 + Vite 5 + react-router-dom + socket.io-client (web) — all TypeScript, ESM, npm workspaces monorepo. Auth via `google-auth-library` (Google Sign-In) with a passwordless local-sign-in fallback when Google isn't configured.

**External libs at runtime:** GSAP (animations), canvas-confetti (180s/checkouts), Chart.js + chartjs-plugin-annotation + react-chartjs-2 (momentum graph), Google Fonts (Oswald, Barlow, Barlow Condensed), Google Identity Services (sign-in).

## Server (apps/server/src/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.ts` | Process entry — builds the app via `buildApp`, prunes expired sessions, serves the built SPA in prod (`@fastify/static` + SPA fallback), attaches Socket.IO, listens |
| `app.ts` | `buildApp()` — Fastify factory: helmet (CSP for GSI), CORS allowlist, rate-limit (keyed by session player, falls back to IP), global `/api/*` auth preHandler (except `/api/auth/*`), registers all route plugins. Test-friendly options (`helmet`/`rateLimit` toggles) |
| `auth.ts` | Google credential verify + player upsert, local-player upsert, session create/lookup/prune, `isAdmin` (ADMIN_EMAILS + local-admin sentinel), `requireSession`/`requireAdmin` guards, `playerFromRequest` |
| `sanitize.ts` | Strips `email`/`google_id` PII from player rows for non-self/non-admin viewers; `stripPiiFromGameState` for socket broadcasts |
| `db.ts` | better-sqlite3 connection, WAL mode, FK on, idempotent schema + additive `ALTER`s, `PRAGMA user_version` migration (one-shot pre-Google local wipe), AI player seeding |
| `types.ts` | Shared TS types: `Player`, `Session`, `Game`, `Turn`, `CricketState`, `MatchSettings`, `FullGameState`, practice rows, drill/difficulty enums |
| `darts.ts` | `parseDartScore`, `parseCricketDart`, `isValidDart` |
| `checkout-table.ts` | 169-entry double-out lookup (2 → 170) |
| `game-state.ts` | `getFullGameState(gameId)` — single aggregator: players, turns, scores, set/leg tracking, current player index (replays turns so uneven sets keep the right thrower) |
| `ai-engine.ts` | 10-level dart-physics simulator + X01 / cricket strategy |
| `practice-engine.ts` | Pure drill logic for the 4 practice modes (checkout / scoring / around-the-clock / doubles) |
| `tournament-engine.ts` | Pure knockout bracket generation (power-of-two padding, byes to top seeds, winner-path wiring); no DB |
| `tournament-store.ts` | Tournament DB layer: create/get/list/launch/settle/delete; `settleCompletedGame` is the seam target |
| `socket-handler.ts` | `join-game`, `submit-turn`, `undo-turn`, `join/leave-tournament` handlers; session auth middleware; turn validation; bust + leg/set transitions; cricket scoring + undo revert; AI triggering; the `onGameCompleted` tournament seam |
| `routes/tournaments.ts` | Tournament CRUD + match launch (`/api/tournaments…`), auth-scoped |
| `routes/auth.ts` | `/api/auth/{config,google,local,me,logout}` |
| `routes/players.ts` | CRUD `/api/players` (self-service rename + admin management) |
| `routes/games.ts` | CRUD `/api/games`; participant/admin scoping; PII scrub on responses |
| `routes/stats.ts` | `/api/stats/players/:id`, `/api/stats/games/:id` (with leg-by-leg breakdown) |
| `routes/practice.ts` | Practice session lifecycle endpoints |
| `routes/admin.ts` | `DELETE /api/admin/reset` (admin-only) |

## Frontend (apps/web/src/)

### Entry & shell
- `main.tsx` — ReactDOM root, `BrowserRouter`, wraps `<App>` in `<AuthProvider>`
- `App.tsx` — gates on `useAuth()`: loading splash → `<SignIn>` when signed out → routed app. Routes: `/`, `/setup`, `/game`, `/practice`, `/profile`, `/stats`, `/admin` (admin-gated)
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — `AuthProvider` + `useAuth`: Google + local sign-in, `/api/auth/me` rehydrate, sign-out, `auth:expired` handling, socket disconnect on auth change

### Pages
- `pages/SignIn.tsx` — Google Identity Services button + local sign-in (when enabled)
- `pages/Home.tsx` — mode-picker landing (match modes + practice drills) + Resume strip for in-progress games
- `pages/Setup.tsx` — per-mode setup: format pickers, player select grid, inline add-player, AI opponent, bull-throw start; practice setup branch
- `pages/GamePage.tsx` — owns the live game; wires `useGame`, suggestion, animations, voice, wake-lock, post-match overlay
- `pages/PracticePage.tsx` — live practice drill UI
- `pages/TournamentPage.tsx` — knockout bracket + fixtures + champion screen (live via the `tournament:<id>` socket room)
- `pages/Profile.tsx` — self-service profile (rename / nickname)
- `pages/Admin.tsx` — admin player management
- `pages/Stats.tsx` — per-human-player lifetime stats

### Hooks
- `hooks/useGame.ts` — subscribes to `game-state`, `game-over`, `ai-thinking`; exposes `submitTurn`, `undoTurn`; double-submit lock; triggers throw animations on new turns

### Libraries
- `lib/api.ts` — typed `fetch` wrapper (`get`/`post`/`put`/`del`); 401 → clear token + `auth:expired`
- `lib/auth.ts` — token storage + `authHeaders`
- `lib/darts.ts` — `parseDartScore`, `formatDart`
- `lib/socket.ts` — singleton socket.io-client (auth token in handshake)
- `lib/suggestions.ts` — skill-tier suggestion engine + checkout hints + bogey + presets
- `lib/modes.ts` — match-mode metadata
- `lib/practice.ts` — drill metadata + practice API helpers
- `lib/bull-throw.ts` — bull-throw ordering logic
- `lib/animations.ts` — GSAP overlays (180 / ton / game-shot / bust), Web Audio tones, Web Speech voice caller

### Components
`AppHeader`, `Scoreboard`, `ThrowHistory`, `SuggestionStrip`, `X01Input`, `DartByDartPad`, `CricketInput`, `CricketGrid`, `PracticeDartPad`, `PostMatchReview`, `ModeTile`, `PlayerSelectGrid`, `AddPlayerInline`, `PlayerAvatar`, `BullThrow`, `UpdatePrompt` (PWA), `TestModeBadge`

## Build & Run

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `npm install` | Install all workspace deps (first run compiles `better-sqlite3`) |
| `npm run dev` | Fastify (`tsx watch`) on `:3000` + Vite on `:5173` (`/api` & `/socket.io` proxied) |
| `npm run build` | Builds both workspaces — `apps/server/dist` + `apps/web/dist` |
| `npm start` | Runs compiled server; serves the built web at the same port |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-checks all workspaces |
| `npm test` | Runs server + web unit/integration tests (vitest) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright UI tests (501 + cricket) |
| `docker compose up -d --build` | Build image and run on `:8080` |

---

## Auth

- **Google Sign-In** gates the whole app. `/api/auth/config` drives the client at runtime; the global `/api/*` preHandler (except `/api/auth/*`) requires a session; Socket.IO validates the session in handshake middleware.
- **Local sign-in** is a passwordless fallback enabled only when no Google client id is set (self-hosted convenience). Local accounts carry the `admin@local` sentinel and get admin in that mode.
- **Admins** = emails in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (plus the local-admin sentinel in local mode). Admin-only: `DELETE /api/admin/reset`, cross-player management, viewing any game.
- **PII scrubbing** — `email`/`google_id` are stripped from player rows sent to anyone who isn't that player or an admin (REST responses + socket broadcasts).
- **Test/dev config** — `TEST_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` takes precedence over `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; when used, a "Test config" badge shows in the UI.

---

## CI

`.forgejo/workflows/build-push.yml` runs on every push to `main` (or `workflow_dispatch`) and on changes to `Dockerfile`, `apps/**`, `package.json`, or `tsconfig.base.json`. Builds and pushes `forgejo.csodakucko.net/lendev/darts-game:<short-sha>` + `:latest` via the `homelab` runner.

## Future Enhancements

### High Impact
- [~] **Phase 8 — Online multiplayer** — invite codes, server-side turn gate, friends, async play, spectator mode. Designed in PLAN.md §"Phase 8" (rollout 8a–8d).
  - [x] **8a — server-side turn gate + invite codes** (2026-06-12): `is_online` + `invite_code` games, capacity via `settings.maxPlayers`, `POST /api/games/join`, online-only turn ownership enforcement, Setup online toggle + Home join-by-code + GamePage waiting/your-turn states. AI disallowed in online games for now.
  - [ ] 8b — friends graph + presence
  - [ ] 8c — async play + web push (depends on PWA, already landed)
  - [ ] 8d — spectator mode
- [ ] **Remote Play** — WebRTC video feed + synced scoreboard over the internet (`REMOTE-PLAY.md`)

### Medium Impact
- [~] **Phase 9 — Tournament Mode** — designed in `TOURNAMENT_MODE.md`.
  - [x] **T0 + T1 — Knockout** (2026-06-12): engine + store + routes + `TournamentPage` (bracket/fixtures/champion), single-device, fully tested
  - [ ] T2 — League (round-robin + standings table)
  - [ ] T3 — Groups → Knockout
  - [ ] T4 — AI "simulate match"
  - [ ] T5 — Online tournaments (needs more of Phase 8)
- [ ] Dartboard SVG tap input
- [ ] Head-to-head records
- [ ] Game history CSV export
- [ ] **H4 — auth token → HttpOnly cookie + CSRF** (defense-in-depth; deferred until an XSS sink appears, see PLAN.md)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Haptic feedback (mobile vibration on big scores)
- [ ] Custom game modes (701, 1001, etc.)
- [ ] Theme customization (light, custom accents)
- [ ] Spectator mode (read-only live view) — subsumed by Phase 8d
